### So you want to know some more about me huh?

Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Program of the Study of LGBT Health](http://www.lgbthealthprogram.org/phd-program), a [Jonas-Blaustein Scholar](https://jonasphilanthropies.org), and a Diversity Fellow at Columbia University School of Nursing.

I currently serve as the HPiT Co-Chair on the executive board of [GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equity](http://www.glma.org/).

Prior to my healthcare career, I was a certified natural chef, perinatal nutritionist, and clinical herbalist. I used this knowledge and training to bootstrap two profitable small businesses in the health and wellness industry: [Ambrosia Healing](http://ambrosiahealing.com) and [Maternity Maven](http://maternitymaven.com)

Things that make me happiest include: slow cooking, challenging conversations, being in the mountains, traveling to remote places, and running outside during the fall. 

I currently live in NYC with my wife and several plant babies.
